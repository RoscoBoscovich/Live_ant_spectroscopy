Accurate identification of insect species is crucial for understanding biodiversity and protecting biosecurity. Traditional morphological identification methods are often limited, especially for detecting and monitoring invasive species. Molecular taxonomy techniques, such as DNA barcoding and cuticular hydrocarbon analysis, have shown promise but can be expensive and slow. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a non-invasive, cost-effective, and rapid tool for insect species identification. While previous studies have primarily focused on deceased specimens, this study explores the viability of using NIRS for identifying live, adult worker ants. The study examines the ability of NIRS to distinguish between the highly invasive yellow crazy ant (YCA), Anoplolepis gracilipes, and native, Australian ant species, using benchtop and portable, handheld instruments. The results demonstrate that NIRS can accurately identify live adult worker ants, particularly for distinguishing the invasive yellow crazy ant from the Australian natives. This demonstrates the potential for NIRS as a robust method for rapid, in-field live ant identification, which is crucial for biodiversity assessments and pest management strategies.
